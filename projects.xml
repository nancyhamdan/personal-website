        <title>Quiz Game In Go</title>
        <desc>
            Created a console-based quiz game using Go where the user is asked to give a csv file with questions and answers and the 
            application gives the user random questions from the file, gives them a limited time to answer, and finally shows the userâ€™s 
            score. Used goroutines and channels to create the limited time feature.

        <title>Hash Based 2-Sum Problem Solution</title>
        <desc>
            Created a Hash based solution to the 2-Sum problem. Created hash tables and implemented two hashing algorithms to insert data 
            to the tables and search them, FIFO and Double Hashing.
